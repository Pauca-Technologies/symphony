# Symphony Service Specification

Status: Draft v1 (language-agnostic)

Purpose: Define a service that orchestrates coding agents to get project work done.

## Normative Language

The key words `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `REQUIRED`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `RECOMMENDED`, `MAY`, and
`OPTIONAL` in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

`Implementation-defined` means the behavior is part of the implementation contract, but this
specification does not prescribe one universal policy. Implementations MUST document the selected
behavior.

## 1. Problem Statement

Symphony is a long-running automation service that continuously reads work from an issue tracker
(Linear in this specification version), creates an isolated workspace for each issue, and runs a
coding agent session for that issue inside the workspace.

The service solves four operational problems:

- It turns issue execution into a repeatable daemon workflow instead of manual scripts.
- It isolates agent execution in per-issue workspaces so agent commands run only inside per-issue
  workspace directories.
- It keeps the workflow policy in-repo (`WORKFLOW.md`) so teams version the agent prompt and runtime
  settings with their code.
- It provides enough observability to operate and debug multiple concurrent agent runs.

Implementations are expected to document their trust and safety posture explicitly. This
specification does not require a single approval, sandbox, or operator-confirmation policy; some
implementations target trusted environments with a high-trust configuration, while others require
stricter approvals or sandboxing.

Important boundary:

- Symphony is a scheduler/runner and tracker reader.
- Ticket writes (state transitions, comments, PR links) are typically performed by the coding agent
  using tools available in the workflow/runtime environment.
- A successful run can end at a workflow-defined handoff state (for example `Human Review`), not
  necessarily `Done`.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals

- Poll the issue tracker on a fixed cadence and dispatch work with bounded concurrency.
- Maintain a single authoritative orchestrator state for dispatch, retries, and reconciliation.
- Create deterministic per-issue workspaces and preserve them across runs.
- Stop active runs when issue state changes make them ineligible.
- Recover from transient failures with exponential backoff.
- Load runtime behavior from a repository-owned `WORKFLOW.md` contract.
- Expose operator-visible observability (at minimum structured logs).
- Support tracker/filesystem-driven restart recovery without requiring a persistent database; exact
  in-memory scheduler state is not restored. Implementations MAY additionally preserve live runs in
  reconnectable worker processes.

### 2.2 Non-Goals

- Rich web UI or multi-tenant control plane.
- Prescribing a specific dashboard or terminal UI implementation.
- General-purpose workflow engine or distributed job scheduler.
- Built-in business logic for how to edit tickets, PRs, or comments. (That logic lives in the
  workflow prompt and agent tooling.)
- Mandating strong sandbox controls beyond what the coding agent and host OS provide.
- Mandating a single default approval, sandbox, or operator-confirmation posture for all
  implementations.

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 Main Components

1. `Workflow Loader`
   - Reads `WORKFLOW.md`.
   - Parses YAML front matter and prompt body.
   - Returns `{config, prompt_template}`.

2. `Config Layer`
   - Exposes typed getters for workflow config values.
   - Applies defaults and environment variable indirection.
   - Performs validation used by the orchestrator before dispatch.

3. `Issue Tracker Client`
   - Fetches candidate issues in active states.
   - Fetches current states for specific issue IDs (reconciliation).
   - Fetches terminal-state issues during startup cleanup.
   - Normalizes tracker payloads into a stable issue model.

4. `Orchestrator`
   - Owns the poll tick.
   - Owns the in-memory runtime state.
   - Decides which issues to dispatch, retry, stop, or release.
   - Tracks session metrics and retry queue state.

5. `Workspace Manager`
   - Maps issue identifiers to workspace paths.
   - Ensures per-issue workspace directories exist.
   - Runs workspace lifecycle hooks.
   - Cleans workspaces for terminal issues.

6. `Agent Runner`
   - Creates workspace.
   - Builds prompt from issue + workflow template.
   - Launches the coding agent app-server client.
   - Streams agent updates back to the orchestrator.

7. `Status Surface` (OPTIONAL)
   - Presents human-readable runtime status (for example terminal output, dashboard, or other
     operator-facing view).

8. `Logging`
   - Emits structured runtime logs to one or more configured sinks.

### 3.2 Abstraction Levels

Symphony is easiest to port when kept in these layers:

1. `Policy Layer` (repo-defined)
   - `WORKFLOW.md` prompt body.
   - Team-specific rules for ticket handling, validation, and handoff.

2. `Configuration Layer` (typed getters)
   - Parses front matter into typed runtime settings.
   - Handles defaults, environment tokens, and path normalization.

3. `Coordination Layer` (orchestrator)
   - Polling loop, issue eligibility, concurrency, retries, reconciliation.

4. `Execution Layer` (workspace + agent subprocess)
   - Filesystem lifecycle, workspace preparation, coding-agent protocol.

5. `Integration Layer` (Linear adapter)
   - API calls and normalization for tracker data.

6. `Observability Layer` (logs + OPTIONAL status surface)
   - Operator visibility into orchestrator and agent behavior.

### 3.3 External Dependencies

- Issue tracker API (Linear for `tracker.kind: linear` in this specification version).
- Local filesystem for workspaces and logs.
- OPTIONAL workspace population tooling (for example Git CLI, if used).
- Coding-agent executable that supports the targeted Codex app-server mode.
- Host environment authentication for the issue tracker and coding agent.

## 4. Core Domain Model

### 4.1 Entities

#### 4.1.1 Issue

Normalized issue record used by orchestration, prompt rendering, and observability output.

Fields:

- `id` (string)
  - Stable tracker-internal ID.
- `identifier` (string)
  - Human-readable ticket key (example: `ABC-123`).
- `title` (string)
- `description` (string or null)
- `priority` (integer or null)
  - Lower numbers are higher priority in dispatch sorting.

  - Tracker-provided branch metadata if available.
- `url` (string or null)
- `labels` (list of strings)

    - `state` (string or null)
- `created_at` (timestamp or null)
- `updated_at` (timestamp or null)
- `comments` (list of normalized comment records)
  - Bounded activity captured immediately before an outer agent dispatch.
  - Each record contains `id`, `body`, `author_id`, `author_name`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
- `comments_truncated` (boolean)
  - True when older comments exist outside the captured activity window.

#### 4.1.2 Workflow Definition

Parsed `WORKFLOW.md` payload:

- `config` (map)
  - YAML front matter root object.

#### 4.1.5 Run Attempt

One execution attempt for one issue.

Fields (logical):

- `Issue ID`
  - Use for tracker lookups and internal map keys.
- `Issue Identifier`
  - Use for human-readable logs and workspace naming.
- `Workspace Key`
  - Derive from `issue.identifier` by replacing any character not in `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` with `_`.
  - Use the sanitized value for the workspace directory name.
- `Normalized Issue State`
  - Compare states after `lowercase`.
- `Session ID`
  - Compose from coding-agent `thread_id` and `turn_id` as `<thread_id>-<turn_id>`.

## 5. Workflow Specification (Repository Contract)

### 5.1 File Discovery and Path Resolution

Workflow file path precedence:

1. Explicit application/runtime setting (set by CLI startup path).
2. Default: `WORKFLOW.md` in the current process working directory.

Loader behavior:

- If the file cannot be read, return `missing_workflow_file` error.
- The workflow file is expected to be repository-owned and version-controlled.

### 5.2 File Format

`WORKFLOW.md` is a Markdown file with OPTIONAL YAML front matter.

Design note:

- `WORKFLOW.md` SHOULD be self-contained enough to describe and run different workflows (prompt,
  runtime settings, hooks, and tracker selection/config) without requiring out-of-band
  service-specific configuration.

Parsing rules:

- If file starts with `---`, parse lines until the next `---` as YAML front matter.
- Remaining lines become the prompt body.
- If front matter is absent, treat the entire file as prompt body and use an empty config map.
- YAML front matter MUST decode to a map/object; non-map YAML is an error.
- Prompt body is trimmed before use.

Returned workflow object:

- `config`: front matter root object (not nested under a `config` key).
- `prompt_template`: trimmed Markdown body.

### 5.3 Front Matter Schema

Top-level keys:

- `tracker`
- `polling`
- `workspace`
- `hooks`
- `agent`
- `codex`

Unknown keys SHOULD be ignored for forward compatibility.

Note:

- The workflow front matter is extensible. Extensions MAY define additional top-level keys without
  changing the core schema above.
- Extensions SHOULD document their field schema, defaults, validation rules, and whether changes
  apply dynamically or require restart.

#### 5.3.1 `tracker` (object)

Fields:

- `kind` (string)
  - REQUIRED for dispatch.
  - Current supported value: `linear`
- `endpoint` (string)
  - Default for `tracker.kind == "linear"`: `https://api.linear.app/graphql`
- `api_key` (string)
  - MAY be a literal token or `$VAR_NAME`.
  - Canonical environment variable for `tracker.kind == "linear"`: `LINEAR_API_KEY`.
  - If `$VAR_NAME` resolves to an empty string, treat the key as missing.
- `project_slug` (string)
  - REQUIRED for dispatch when `tracker.kind == "linear"`.
  - May be a literal slug or `$VAR_NAME`.
  - Canonical environment variable for `tracker.kind == "linear"`: `LINEAR_PROJECT_SLUG`.
  - If `$VAR_NAME` resolves to an empty string, treat the slug as missing.
- `active_states` (list of strings)
  - Default: `Todo`, `In Progress`
- `terminal_states` (list of strings)
  - Default: `Closed`, `Cancelled`, `Canceled`, `Duplicate`, `Done`

#### 5.3.2 `polling` (object)

Fields:

- `interval_ms` (integer)
  - Default: `30000`
  - Changes SHOULD be re-applied at runtime and affect future tick scheduling without restart.

#### 5.3.3 `workspace` (object)

Fields:

- `root` (path string or `$VAR`)
  - Default: `<system-temp>/symphony_workspaces`
  - `~` is expanded.
  - Relative paths are resolved relative to the directory containing `WORKFLOW.md`.
  - The effective workspace root is normalized to an absolute path before use.

#### 5.3.4 `hooks` (object)

Fields:

- `after_create` (multiline shell script string, OPTIONAL)
  - Runs only when a workspace directory is newly created.
  - Failure aborts workspace creation.
- `session_start` (multiline shell script string, OPTIONAL)
  - Runs before each fresh or resumed coding-agent session after workspace preparation and before
    launching the coding agent.
  - Failure is logged and surfaced in the first-turn task context but does not abort the current
    attempt.
  - Implementations SHOULD surface generated Markdown links under `docs/agent-workpad/<branch>/` to
    the first turn as annotated startup artifacts.
  - A repository MAY describe those artifacts by emitting a one-line JSON object containing an
    `artifacts` array. Each entry contains a repository-relative `path` under
    `docs/agent-workpad/` and a short `description`. Implementations MUST reject paths outside that
    root and SHOULD retain path-only discovery for hooks that do not emit this metadata.
- `before_run` (multiline shell script string, OPTIONAL)
  - Runs before each agent attempt after workspace preparation and before launching the coding
    agent.
  - Failure aborts the current attempt.
- `before_handoff` (multiline shell script string, OPTIONAL)
  - Runs before an agent-driven Linear status transition from `In Progress` to a review handoff
    state such as `In Review`.
  - Failure cancels the status transition and feeds hook remediation into the next agent turn.
- `before_handoff_timeout_ms` (integer, OPTIONAL)
  - Overrides `hooks.timeout_ms` for each initial or polling invocation of `before_handoff`.
- `before_handoff_stale_ms` (integer, OPTIONAL, default `120000`)
  - Maximum accepted heartbeat age for an asynchronous pending handoff gate.
- `after_run` (multiline shell script string, OPTIONAL)
  - Runs after each agent attempt (success, failure, timeout, or cancellation) once the workspace
    exists.
  - Failure is logged but ignored.
- `before_remove` (multiline shell script string, OPTIONAL)
  - Runs before workspace deletion if the directory exists.
  - Failure is logged but ignored; cleanup still proceeds.
- `timeout_ms` (integer, OPTIONAL)
  - Default: `60000`
  - Applies to all workspace hooks.
  - Invalid values fail configuration validation.
  - Changes SHOULD be re-applied at runtime for future hook executions.

#### 5.3.5 `agent` (object)

Fields:

- `max_concurrent_agents` (integer)
  - Default: `10`
  - Changes SHOULD be re-applied at runtime and affect subsequent dispatch decisions.
- `test_worker_limit` (positive integer, OPTIONAL extension)
  - Default: `2`.
  - Bounds test-runner worker processes inside each agent; it MUST NOT reduce agent-slot concurrency.
  - The effective value SHOULD be exposed as `SYMPHONY_TEST_WORKER_LIMIT` and in first-turn runtime
    guidance with runner-supported options.
  - Lifecycle hooks that perform validation SHOULD inherit the same effective value.
- `max_turns` (positive integer)
  - Default: `20`
  - Limits the number of coding-agent turns within one worker session.
  - Invalid values fail configuration validation.
- `max_retry_backoff_ms` (integer)
  - Default: `300000` (5 minutes)
  - Changes SHOULD be re-applied at runtime and affect future retry scheduling.
- `max_concurrent_agents_by_state` (map `state_name -> positive integer`)
  - Default: empty map.
  - State keys are normalized (`lowercase`) for lookup.
  - Invalid entries (non-positive or non-numeric) are ignored.
- `routing` (object, OPTIONAL extension for routed repository workflows)
  - Allows a repository to select a Codex execution profile from the nature of each issue instead
    of using one repository-wide model.
  - `classifier` is REQUIRED and contains `backend` (currently `codex`), `model`,
    `reasoning_effort`, and an optional positive `timeout_ms`. The classifier SHOULD be ephemeral,
    schema-constrained, limited to a bounded issue snapshot, and run without repository project
    instructions or implementation-agent dynamic tools. Issue content MUST be treated as untrusted
    data. Its structured result SHOULD include the execution profile, task class, confidence,
    risk, complexity, ambiguity, and bounded reasons.
  - `profiles` is a REQUIRED non-empty map from profile name to `backend`, `model`,
    `reasoning_effort`, and classifier-facing `description`. This extension currently supports the
    `codex` backend.
  - `default_profile` MUST name a configured profile.
  - `fallback_profile` MAY name a configured quality fallback and defaults to `default_profile`.
  - Supported reasoning-effort names are `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`.
  - A classifier failure SHOULD select `fallback_profile`, not silently use a weaker model.
  - Implementations MAY promote high risk, complexity, or ambiguity to `fallback_profile` even when
    the classifier proposed another profile.
  - A single exact `agent:<profile>` issue label MAY bypass classification. Multiple matching
    profile labels SHOULD select `fallback_profile`.
  - Host/operator label presets MAY take precedence over repository-owned routing profiles.
  - The selected model MUST be applied to Codex `thread/start`, and the selected reasoning effort
    MUST be applied to each Codex `turn/start`; routing MUST NOT be observational-only when enabled.
- `efficiency` (object, OPTIONAL extension)
  - Defines telemetry-driven soft-budget and review-routing policy as specified in Section 13.7.
  - `mode` is `off`, `shadow` (default), or `enforce`; `capsule_max_bytes` MUST be bounded to a
    safe positive range, and `extreme_multiplier` MUST be at least `1.0`.
  - `task_profiles` maps supported task classifier values to names in the non-empty `profiles` map.
    Profiles define positive token/time/byte/lens/iteration thresholds, optional reviewer model and
    reasoning effort, an explicit `allow_overage` policy, and requested risk-relevant lens names.
  - One exact valid `budget:<profile>` issue label MAY override the derived budget. A present invalid
    budget label or more than one distinct valid budget profile MUST select the high-risk profile
    and retain override provenance for operator inspection.

#### 5.3.6 `codex` (object)

Fields:

For Codex-owned config values such as `approval_policy`, `thread_sandbox`, and
`turn_sandbox_policy`, supported values are defined by the targeted Codex app-server version.
Implementors SHOULD treat them as pass-through Codex config values rather than relying on a
hand-maintained enum in this spec. To inspect the installed Codex schema, run
`codex app-server generate-json-schema --out <dir>` and inspect the relevant definitions referenced
by `v2/ThreadStartParams.json` and `v2/TurnStartParams.json`. Implementations MAY validate these
fields locally if they want stricter startup checks.

- `command` (string shell command)
  - Default: `codex app-server`
  - The runtime launches this command via `bash -lc` in the workspace directory.
  - The launched process MUST speak a compatible app-server protocol over stdio.
- `approval_policy` (Codex `AskForApproval` value)
  - Default: implementation-defined.
- `thread_sandbox` (Codex `SandboxMode` value)
  - Default: implementation-defined.
- `turn_sandbox_policy` (Codex `SandboxPolicy` value)
  - Default: implementation-defined.
- `turn_timeout_ms` (integer)
  - Default: `3600000` (1 hour)
- `read_timeout_ms` (integer)
  - Default: `5000`
- `stall_timeout_ms` (integer)
  - Default: `300000` (5 minutes)
  - If `<= 0`, stall detection is disabled.

### 5.4 Prompt Template Contract

The Markdown body of `WORKFLOW.md` is the repository workflow prompt template. The host-owned task
context supplies issue details and tracker activity independently of this template.

Rendering requirements:

- Use a strict template engine (Liquid-compatible semantics are sufficient).
- Unknown variables MUST fail rendering.
- Unknown filters MUST fail rendering.

Template input variables:

- `issue` (object)
  - Includes all normalized issue fields, including labels and blockers.
- `attempt` (integer or null)
  - `null`/absent on first attempt.
  - Integer on retry or continuation run.

Fallback prompt behavior:

- If the workflow prompt body is empty, the runtime MAY use a minimal default prompt
  (`You are working on an issue from Linear.`).
- Workflow file read/parse failures are configuration/validation errors and SHOULD NOT silently fall
  back to a prompt.

### 5.5 Workflow Validation and Error Surface

Error classes:

- `missing_workflow_file`
- `workflow_parse_error`
- `workflow_front_matter_not_a_map`
- `template_parse_error` (during prompt rendering)
- `template_render_error` (unknown variable/filter, invalid interpolation)

Dispatch gating behavior:

- Workflow file read/YAML errors block new dispatches until fixed.
- Template errors fail only the affected run attempt.

## 6. Configuration Specification

### 6.1 Configuration Resolution Pipeline

Configuration is resolved in this order:

1. Select the workflow file path (explicit runtime setting, otherwise cwd default).
2. Parse YAML front matter into a raw config map.
3. Apply built-in defaults for missing OPTIONAL fields.
4. Resolve `$VAR_NAME` indirection only for config values that explicitly contain `$VAR_NAME`.
5. Coerce and validate typed values.

Environment variables do not globally override YAML values. They are used only when a config value
explicitly references them.

Value coercion semantics:

- Path/command fields support:
  - `~` home expansion
  - `$VAR` expansion for env-backed path values
  - Apply expansion only to values intended to be local filesystem paths; do not rewrite URIs or
    arbitrary shell command strings.
- Relative `workspace.root` values resolve relative to the directory containing the selected
  `WORKFLOW.md`.

### 6.2 Dynamic Reload Semantics

Dynamic reload is REQUIRED:

- The software MUST detect `WORKFLOW.md` changes.
- On change, it MUST re-read and re-apply workflow config and prompt template without restart.
- The software MUST attempt to adjust live behavior to the new config (for example polling
  cadence, concurrency limits, active/terminal states, codex settings, workspace paths/hooks, and
  prompt content for future runs).
- Reloaded config applies to future dispatch, retry scheduling, reconciliation decisions, hook
  execution, and agent launches.
- Implementations are not REQUIRED to restart in-flight agent sessions automatically when config
  changes.
- Extensions that manage their own listeners/resources (for example an HTTP server port change) MAY
  require restart unless the implementation explicitly supports live rebind.
- Implementations SHOULD also re-validate/reload defensively during runtime operations (for example
  before dispatch) in case filesystem watch events are missed.
- Invalid reloads MUST NOT crash the service; keep operating with the last known good effective
  configuration and emit an operator-visible error.

### 6.3 Dispatch Preflight Validation

This validation is a scheduler preflight run before attempting to dispatch new work. It validates
the workflow/config needed to poll and launch workers, not a full audit of all possible workflow
behavior.

Startup validation:

- Validate configuration before starting the scheduling loop.
- If startup validation fails, fail startup and emit an operator-visible error.

Per-tick dispatch validation:

- Re-validate before each dispatch cycle.
- If validation fails, skip dispatch for that tick, keep reconciliation active, and emit an
  operator-visible error.

Validation checks:

- Workflow file can be loaded and parsed.
- `tracker.kind` is present and supported.
- `tracker.api_key` is present after `$` resolution.
- `tracker.project_slug` is present when REQUIRED by the selected tracker kind.
- `codex.command` is present and non-empty.

### 6.4 Core Config Fields Summary (Cheat Sheet)

This section is intentionally redundant so a coding agent can implement the config layer quickly.
Extension fields are documented in the extension section that defines them. Core conformance does
not require recognizing or validating extension fields unless that extension is implemented.

- `tracker.kind`: string, REQUIRED, currently `linear`
- `tracker.endpoint`: string, default `https://api.linear.app/graphql` when `tracker.kind=linear`
- `tracker.api_key`: string or `$VAR`, canonical env `LINEAR_API_KEY` when `tracker.kind=linear`

- `tracker.active_states`: list of strings, default `["Todo", "In Progress"]`
- `tracker.terminal_states`: list of strings, default `["Closed", "Cancelled", "Canceled", "Duplicate", "Done"]`

- `codex.read_timeout_ms`: integer, default `5000`
- `codex.stall_timeout_ms`: integer, default `300000`

## 7. Orchestration State Machine

The orchestrator is the only component that mutates scheduling state. All worker outcomes are
reported back to it and converted into explicit state transitions.

### 7.1 Issue Orchestration States

This is not the same as tracker states (`Todo`, `In Progress`, etc.). This is the service's internal
claim state.

1. `Unclaimed`
   - Issue is not running and has no retry scheduled.

2. `Claimed`
   - Orchestrator has reserved the issue to prevent duplicate dispatch.
   - In practice, claimed issues are `Running`, `RetryQueued`, or `Waiting`.

3. `Running`
   - Worker task exists and the issue is tracked in `running` map.

4. `RetryQueued`
   - Worker is not running, but a retry timer exists in `retry_attempts`.

5. `Waiting`
   - Worker is not running and consumes no agent slot.
   - A durable, non-LLM watcher owns a typed external condition and resumes the issue through the
     normal priority/concurrency scheduler after that condition changes.

6. `Released`
   - Claim removed because issue is terminal, non-active, missing, or retry path completed without
     re-dispatch.

Important nuance:

- A successful worker exit does not mean the issue is done forever.
- The worker MAY continue through multiple back-to-back coding-agent turns before it exits.
- After each normal turn completion, the worker re-checks the tracker issue state.
- If the issue is still in an active state, the worker SHOULD start another turn on the same live
  coding-agent thread in the same workspace, up to `agent.max_turns`.
- Reaching `agent.max_turns` ends the current worker session without changing tracker state or
  applying a human-input label. The normal-exit continuation check decides whether to start a new
  worker session.
- The first turn SHOULD use typed prompt sections with stable semantic IDs, source identity,
  renderer version, content hash, and byte/token estimates. The canonical task sections own issue
  details and current tracker activity, followed by the rendered repository workflow rules.
- When an issue carries the host-configured tracker opt-in label, a host-owned constraint SHOULD
  make explicit that bot or App credentials installed by trusted startup hooks are authorized for
  that unattended run. After the agent verifies the injected identity, stale workpad claims that
  bot attribution still needs a separate human authorization MUST NOT cause a Blocked transition;
  missing, invalid, or insufficient credentials remain valid blockers after in-session recovery.
- Exact issue prose repeated by the repository workflow MAY be suppressed when the canonical task
  section is present. Formatting-only equivalent rules MAY be suppressed only when ownership and
  precedence are explicit. Similar or ambiguous safety, tenant/auth, validation, acceptance, and
  handoff text MUST be preserved and diagnosed; generic fuzzy instruction deletion is forbidden.
- Continuation turns SHOULD send a bounded resume capsule to the existing thread, reference
  unchanged static section versions/hashes, and include only changed current candidate metadata and
  current unresolved findings rather than completed remediation history.
- Each turn SHOULD emit prompt observability with the prompt kind, character and byte counts,
  symbolic included-section names, and per-section provenance, size, hash, reuse, and suppression
  decisions. Durable observability MUST NOT contain raw prompt content. An optional, disabled-by-
  default incident debug rendering MAY expose the final composed prompt in logs only when bounded,
  provenance-delimited, and protected by configured secret-field redaction.
- Compact continuation guidance applies only while reusing the same live backend thread. The first
  turn of a newly started backend session SHOULD retain the full task context and repository
  workflow unless that backend has restored verified prior-thread context; a retry attempt alone is
  not proof of restored context.
- Once the worker exits normally, the orchestrator still schedules a short continuation retry
  (about 1 second) so it can re-check whether the issue remains active and needs another worker
  session.
- If the worker successfully requests a typed external wait, normal exit parks the issue instead
  of scheduling the short continuation retry. The workspace is retained and the claim remains
  held so ordinary tracker polling cannot create a duplicate worker.

### 7.2 Run Attempt Lifecycle

A run attempt transitions through these phases:

1. `PreparingWorkspace`
2. `BuildingPrompt`
3. `LaunchingAgentProcess`
4. `InitializingSession`
5. `StreamingTurn`
6. `Finishing`
7. `Succeeded`
8. `Failed`
9. `TimedOut`
10. `Stalled`
11. `CanceledByReconciliation`

Distinct terminal reasons are important because retry logic and logs differ.

### 7.3 Transition Triggers

- `Poll Tick`
  - Reconcile active runs.
  - Validate config.
  - Fetch candidate issues.
  - Dispatch until slots are exhausted.

- `Worker Exit (normal)`
  - Remove running entry.
  - Update aggregate runtime totals.
  - Schedule continuation retry (attempt `1`) after the worker exhausts or finishes its in-process
    turn loop.

- `Worker Exit (abnormal)`
  - Remove running entry.
  - Update aggregate runtime totals.
  - Schedule exponential-backoff retry.

- `Codex Update Event`
  - Update live session fields, token counters, and rate limits.

- `Retry Timer Fired`
  - Re-fetch active candidates and attempt re-dispatch, or release claim if no longer eligible.

- `Reconciliation State Refresh`
  - Stop runs whose issue states are terminal or no longer active.

- `Stall Timeout`
  - Kill worker and schedule retry.

### 7.4 Idempotency and Recovery Rules

- The orchestrator serializes state mutations through one authority to avoid duplicate dispatch.
- `claimed` and `running` checks are REQUIRED before launching any worker.
- Reconciliation runs before dispatch on every tick.
- Restart recovery is tracker-driven and filesystem-driven (without a durable orchestrator DB).
- Startup terminal cleanup removes stale workspaces for issues already in terminal states.

## 8. Polling, Scheduling, and Reconciliation

### 8.1 Poll Loop

At startup, the service validates config, performs startup cleanup, schedules an immediate tick, and
then repeats every `polling.interval_ms`.

The effective poll interval SHOULD be updated when workflow config changes are re-applied.

Tick sequence:

1. Reconcile running issues.
2. Run dispatch preflight validation.
3. Fetch candidate issues from tracker using active states.
4. Sort issues by dependencies and dispatch priority.
5. Dispatch eligible issues while slots remain.
6. Notify observability/status consumers of state changes.

If per-tick validation fails, dispatch is skipped for that tick, but reconciliation still happens
first.

### 8.2 Candidate Selection Rules

An issue is dispatch-eligible only if all are true:

- It has `id`, `identifier`, `title`, and `state`.
- Its state is in `active_states` and not in `terminal_states`.
- It is not already in `running`.
- It is not already in `claimed`.
- Global concurrency slots are available.
- Per-state concurrency slots are available.
- No blocker is non-terminal. This dependency rule applies to every active
  state, including continuations already in progress.

Sorting order (stable intent):

1. Dependencies before dependents (cycles retain the deterministic fallback
   order and MUST NOT deadlock dispatch)
2. `priority` ascending (1 Urgent, 2 High, 3 Medium, 4 Low; 0/null/unknown sorts last)
3. `created_at` oldest first
4. `identifier` lexicographic tie-breaker

### 8.3 Concurrency Control

Global limit:

- `available_slots = max(max_concurrent_agents - running_count, 0)`

Per-state limit:

- `max_concurrent_agents_by_state[state]` if present (state key normalized)
- otherwise fallback to global limit

The runtime counts issues by their current tracked state in the `running` map.

Repository-aware extension:

- A configured `repos[].max_concurrent` is an additional hard ceiling.
- `overlap_policy` is `serialize` (default), `advisory`, or `off`;
  `overlap_threshold` defaults to `0.5`.
- Signals progress from repository identity and issue label/path hints, through
  initial-plan paths, to the actual changed-file manifest. Stronger signals
  replace weaker ones.
- `serialize` queues overlap at or above the threshold and permits disjoint or
  unknown-path work while repository capacity remains. A configured operator
  override label bypasses overlap serialization, never the hard ceiling.
- Queue order is deterministic and dependency/human priority remains
  authoritative. Queue entries expose reason, bounded overlap paths, base age,
  queue time, and suggested order.
- Reservations are derived from live `running` workers, not durable leases.
  Terminal, stalled, blocked, or missing workers release them; after restart no
  stale reservation is restored.

### 8.4 Retry and Backoff

Retry entry creation:

- Cancel any existing retry timer for the same issue.
- Store `attempt`, `identifier`, `error`, `due_at_ms`, and new timer handle.

Backoff formula:

- Normal continuation retries after a clean worker exit use a short fixed delay of `1000` ms.
- Failure-driven retries use `delay = min(10000 * 2^(attempt - 1), agent.max_retry_backoff_ms)`.
- Power is capped by the configured max retry backoff (default `300000` / 5m).
- `agent.max_retries` is the threshold for terminal treatment, not proof that a product issue needs
  human input. Classified operational/infrastructure failures MUST keep the issue active and retry
  at capped backoff after crossing the threshold. An implementation MAY move an issue to `Blocked`
  only for a failure class that explicitly requires human action, such as invalid authentication or
  workflow configuration.

Retry handling behavior:

1. Fetch active candidate issues (not all issues).
2. Find the specific issue by `issue_id`.
3. If not found, release claim.
4. If found and still candidate-eligible:
   - Dispatch if slots are available.
   - Otherwise requeue with error `no available orchestrator slots`.
5. If found but no longer active, release claim.

Note:

- Terminal-state workspace cleanup is handled by startup cleanup and active-run reconciliation
  (including terminal transitions for currently running issues).
- Retry handling mainly operates on active candidates and releases claims when the issue is absent,
  rather than performing terminal cleanup itself.

### 8.5 Active Run Reconciliation

Reconciliation runs every tick and has two parts.

Part A: Stall detection

- Each running issue has a lifecycle state. Normal agent work uses `implementing`; an asynchronous
  shell gate uses `handoff_pending_gate`, and an accepted deferred handoff review uses
  `handoff_pending_review`. Both pending states remain in the running/claimed sets.
- For `implementing`, compute `elapsed_ms` since the newest of:
  - `last_codex_timestamp` if any event has been seen,
  - the current lifecycle state's start time, or
  - `started_at`.
- If implementor `elapsed_ms > codex.stall_timeout_ms`, terminate the worker and queue a retry.
- If `stall_timeout_ms <= 0`, skip implementor stall detection; pending reviews retain their
  reviewer-specific hard timeout.
- For `handoff_pending_review`, do not apply the implementor activity clock and do not dispatch a
  replacement implementor. Convert reviewer events into a minimal heartbeat, scoped to the current
  worker and review job, that refreshes `last_codex_timestamp` without altering session/token
  accounting. Terminate the worker with a visible review-timeout retry if reviewer inactivity
  exceeds the review timeout.
- For `handoff_pending_gate`, do not apply the implementor activity clock, failure retry, or
  max-turn accounting and do not dispatch a replacement implementor. Poll the durable gate by job
  ID without starting a coding-agent turn. Status surfaces MUST expose the job and candidate
  identity, pending age, heartbeat age/time, progress stage, and next-poll delay.
- Persist the captured tracker mutation and pending gate identity outside the agent-writable
  workspace. After process restart, reattach to that job before starting a coding-agent session.
  Repeated requests for the same candidate MUST coalesce. A changed candidate cancels or
  supersedes the old request; a stale pass MUST NOT authorize the mutation.
- A pending review is keyed to the issue and reviewed PR head. Repeated requests while that job is
  pending coalesce into the existing review. Before applying the captured tracker transition,
  re-resolve the PR head; if it changed, clear pending state and require a fresh review.
- Each reviewer attempt MUST start a fresh thread that does not inherit the implementor transcript.
  Its only task context is a bounded, versioned packet for the exact candidate. The packet records
  project/repository and PR identity, resolved base/head SHAs and fingerprint, issue outcome and
  acceptance/non-goals, changed-file/stat manifest, authoritative full-diff commands, applicable
  repository rules, risk/lens rationale, exact-head attestations, prior unresolved findings with
  their reviewed SHA, implementation risks/skipped proof/evidence, and a bounded follow-up delta.
- Packet size and reviewer context/tool-output/timeout settings are repository-configurable with a
  deterministic hard bound and compaction order. Compaction MUST NOT remove access to the complete
  meaningful diff or applicable security/tenant/auth rules. Budget pressure is handled by explicit
  synthesis or a non-approval outcome, never silent candidate reduction. Reviewer attempts use one
  turn; delegated lenses start without parent transcript and receive only their packet slice.
  The final rendered prompt (repository workflow, packet, and runtime/verdict guards) MUST be
  checked against a documented conservative token-to-byte ceiling and fail inconclusively when it
  cannot fit. Successful reviewer tool responses over their configured byte limit MUST compact both
  duplicate text fields with original-size and narrow-query/raw-artifact recovery metadata; failure
  responses MUST remain intact. Reproducible delta-stat prose MUST also be independently bounded.
- Follow-up reviews receive prior open findings plus the prior-head-to-current-head delta. A
  high-risk follow-up MUST perform a final complete base-to-head diff pass. Verdict evidence records
  the packet id, exact reviewed head, inspected scope, and attestations reused versus rerun.
- Parent reviewer and lens threads are attributed independently in telemetry, including packet/head,
  token usage, duration, model, reasoning effort, outcome, and finding count.
- Reviewer request-changes or timeout clears pending state. Request-changes returns control to the
  implementor. Only an authoritative `approved` verdict for the exact pinned candidate head may
  apply the captured tracker transition. Missing/malformed verdicts, reviewer infrastructure or
  session failures, and an exhausted review budget are explicit non-approval outcomes; they retain
  findings and escalation evidence and withhold the captured transition for human resolution.

Part B: Tracker state refresh

- Fetch current issue states for all running issue IDs.
- For each running issue:
  - If tracker state is terminal: terminate worker and clean workspace.
  - If tracker state is still active: update the in-memory issue snapshot.
  - If tracker state is neither active nor terminal: terminate worker without workspace cleanup.
- If state refresh fails, keep workers running and try again on the next tick.

### 8.6 Startup Terminal Workspace Cleanup

When the service starts:

1. Query tracker for issues in terminal states.
2. For each returned issue identifier, remove the corresponding workspace directory.
3. If the terminal-issues fetch fails, log a warning and continue startup.

This prevents stale terminal workspaces from accumulating after restarts.

## 9. Workspace Management and Safety

### 9.1 Workspace Layout

Workspace root:

- `workspace.root` (normalized absolute path)

Per-issue workspace path:

- `<workspace.root>/<sanitized_issue_identifier>`

Workspace persistence:

- Workspaces are reused across runs for the same issue.
- Successful runs do not auto-delete workspaces.

### 9.2 Workspace Creation and Reuse

Input: `issue.identifier`

Algorithm summary:

1. Sanitize identifier to `workspace_key`.
2. Compute workspace path under workspace root.
3. Ensure the workspace path exists as a directory.
4. Mark `created_now=true` only if the directory was created during this call; otherwise
   `created_now=false`.
5. If `created_now=true`, run `after_create` hook if configured.

Notes:

- This section does not assume any specific repository/VCS workflow.
- Workspace preparation beyond directory creation (for example dependency bootstrap, checkout/sync,
  code generation) is implementation-defined and is typically handled via hooks.

### 9.3 OPTIONAL Workspace Population (Implementation-Defined)

The spec does not require any built-in VCS or repository bootstrap behavior.

Implementations MAY populate or synchronize the workspace using implementation-defined logic and/or
hooks (for example `after_create` and/or `before_run`).

Failure handling:

- Workspace population/synchronization failures return an error for the current attempt.
- If failure happens while creating a brand-new workspace, implementations MAY remove the partially
  prepared directory.
- Reused workspaces SHOULD NOT be destructively reset on population failure unless that policy is
  explicitly chosen and documented.

### 9.4 Workspace Hooks

Supported hooks:

- `hooks.after_create`
- `hooks.session_start`
- `hooks.before_run`
- `hooks.before_handoff`
- `hooks.after_run`
- `hooks.before_remove`

Execution contract:

- Execute in a local shell context appropriate to the host OS, with the workspace directory as
  `cwd`.
- On POSIX systems, `sh -lc <script>` (or a stricter equivalent such as `bash -lc <script>`) is a
  conforming default.
- Set `SYMPHONY_RUN=1` and expose the current task snapshot path as
  `SYMPHONY_ISSUE_CONTEXT_FILE` to issue lifecycle hooks. The versioned JSON snapshot MUST be
  written outside the agent-writable workspace, MUST NOT contain tracker credentials, and SHOULD
  be refreshed from the same normalized issue and comment activity used to assemble the first turn
  before session startup and before `hooks.before_handoff`.
- Hook timeout uses `hooks.timeout_ms`; default: `60000 ms`. `before_handoff` may override each
  invocation with `hooks.before_handoff_timeout_ms`.
- Log hook start, failures, and timeouts.
- Emit `gate.before_handoff` telemetry when `before_handoff` fires, including the per-gate
  pass/fail breakdown parsed from hook JSON output when available.
- Invoke `before_handoff` with `SYMPHONY_HANDOFF_GATE_PROTOCOL=1`. A protocol version 1 report
  includes `jobId`, `status`, `identity.candidateHash`, and `identity.exactHash`.
  `identity.prNumber` MUST be either a positive JSON integer or its canonical decimal-string
  representation (for example `1854`; no sign, whitespace, or leading zeroes). Readers MUST accept
  both representations during rolling deployment. Pending/running
  reports additionally include `heartbeatAt`, `heartbeatAgeMs`, `nextPollMs`, and
  `progress.stage`; they exit `3`. Passed reports exit `0`; failed/invalidated reports exit `2`;
  infrastructure errors exit `1`. Polls set `SYMPHONY_HANDOFF_GATE_JOB_ID` and MUST attach to the
  named job rather than starting another underlying gate.
- On pending/running, durably record the original tracker mutation, end the active model turn, and
  poll without a model turn. Apply the mutation only after a passed report is revalidated for the
  exact current candidate. Failed or invalidated terminal results clear pending state and resume
  the implementor once with bounded remediation. Infrastructure terminal results clear pending
  state, fail the worker attempt with a typed infrastructure failure, and use orchestrator backoff
  without consuming an implementor remediation turn.
- For a routed repository with a configured base branch, fetch and revalidate
  that base on the local or SSH worker host that owns the worktree immediately
  before `hooks.before_handoff`. Compute the
  candidate manifest and paths changed between the candidate's merge base and
  the current remote base. Irrelevant advances MUST NOT block. Overlapping
  advances MUST block before the shell hook and any automated review, report
  compact remediation, and count the expensive gates avoided. Required git
  evidence failures fail closed. Symphony MUST NOT automatically rebase,
  reset, stash, or discard a dirty worktree. The exact passing decision MAY be
  passed to the immediately following review attempt, but a later handoff
  attempt MUST fetch again.

Version 1 readers used this issue-only shape. Implementations adding comment activity SHOULD emit
version 2 while accepting version 1 during rolling deployment. Nullable fields remain present.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "capturedAt": "2026-07-28T09:30:00Z",
  "issue": {
    "id": "issue-uuid",
    "identifier": "ENG-123",
    "title": "Short summary",
    "description": "Rendered task scope",
    "url": "https://linear.app/example/issue/ENG-123",
    "state": "In Progress",
    "labels": ["repo:example"],
    "updatedAt": "2026-07-28T09:29:00Z"
  }
}
```

Version 2 adds bounded comment activity to `issue`:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "capturedAt": "2026-07-29T10:01:00Z",
  "issue": {
    "id": "issue-uuid",
    "identifier": "ENG-123",
    "title": "Short summary",
    "description": "Rendered task scope",
    "url": "https://linear.app/example/issue/ENG-123",
    "state": "In Progress",
    "labels": ["repo:example", "needs-human-input"],
    "comments": [
      {
        "id": "comment-uuid",
        "body": "Decision: use option B.",
        "author": {"id": "user-uuid", "name": "Product owner"},
        "createdAt": "2026-07-29T10:00:00Z",
        "updatedAt": "2026-07-29T10:00:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "commentsTruncated": false,
    "updatedAt": "2026-07-29T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

The same environment variable SHOULD be passed to the inner agent process so repository-owned
commands run by the agent can consume the snapshot. Tracker credentials remain server-side; live
tracker reads and writes use an explicitly exposed client-side tool when the implementation offers
one.

Failure semantics:

- `after_create` failure or timeout is fatal to workspace creation.
- `session_start` failure or timeout is logged, emitted as telemetry, and surfaced as advisory
  context; it is not fatal to the current run attempt.
- `before_run` failure or timeout is fatal to the current run attempt.
- A legacy or protocol-declared validation failure from `before_handoff` cancels the attempted
  tracker state transition and provides remediation to the next agent turn. Protocol verification,
  timeout, and infrastructure failures cancel the transition and fail the worker attempt for
  orchestrator backoff instead. A valid protocol pending/running result is neither a failure nor a
  timeout and does not consume a retry or coding-agent turn.
- `after_run` failure or timeout is logged and ignored.
- `before_remove` failure or timeout is logged and ignored.

### 9.5 Safety Invariants

This is the most important portability constraint.

Invariant 1: Run the coding agent only in the per-issue workspace path.

- Before launching the coding-agent subprocess, validate:
  - `cwd == workspace_path`

Invariant 2: Workspace path MUST stay inside workspace root.

- Normalize both paths to absolute.
- Require `workspace_path` to have `workspace_root` as a prefix directory.
- Reject any path outside the workspace root.

Invariant 3: Workspace key is sanitized.

- Only `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` allowed in workspace directory names.
- Replace all other characters with `_`.

## 10. Agent Runner Protocol (Coding Agent Integration)

This section defines Symphony's language-neutral responsibilities when integrating a Codex
app-server. The Codex app-server protocol for the targeted Codex version is the source of truth for
protocol schemas, message payloads, transport framing, and method names.

Protocol source of truth:

- Implementations MUST send messages that are valid for the targeted Codex app-server version.
- Implementations MUST consult the targeted Codex app-server documentation or generated schema
  instead of treating this specification as a protocol schema.
- If this specification appears to conflict with the targeted Codex app-server protocol, the Codex
  protocol controls protocol shape and transport behavior.
- Symphony-specific requirements in this section still control orchestration behavior, workspace
  selection, prompt construction, continuation handling, and observability extraction.

### 10.1 Launch Contract

Subprocess launch parameters:

- Command: `codex.command`
- Invocation: `bash -lc <codex.command>`
- Working directory: workspace path
- Transport/framing: the protocol transport required by the targeted Codex app-server version

Notes:

- The default command is `codex app-server`.
- When `agent.pre_command` is configured, implementations MAY disable Codex shell snapshots for the
  thread so a shell-profile reload cannot override environment changes made by the pre-command.
- Approval policy, sandbox policy, cwd, prompt input, and OPTIONAL tool declarations are supplied
  using fields supported by the targeted Codex app-server version.

RECOMMENDED additional process settings:

- Max line size: 10 MB (for safe buffering)

### 10.2 Session Startup Responsibilities

Reference: https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server/

Startup MUST follow the targeted Codex app-server contract. Symphony additionally requires the
client to:

- Start the app-server subprocess in the per-issue workspace.
- Initialize the app-server session using the targeted Codex app-server protocol.
- Create or resume a coding-agent thread according to the targeted protocol.
- Supply the absolute per-issue workspace path as the thread/turn working directory wherever the
  targeted protocol accepts cwd.
- Start the first turn with a canonical host-owned task context containing the normalized issue
  details.
- Fetch a bounded, most-recently-updated issue-comment window immediately before each outer agent
  dispatch and place it immediately after the issue details as required issue activity. If this
  required read fails, fail the worker attempt so the orchestrator can retry rather than starting
  with incomplete input.
- Mark truncated activity explicitly so the workflow can request older comments through an
  available live tracker tool only when necessary.
- Place annotated Markdown artifacts produced by `session_start` after current tracker activity,
  then place the rendered repository workflow after the complete task context. Hook stdout SHOULD
  remain diagnostic output rather than prompt content.
- Start later in-worker continuation turns on the same live thread with continuation guidance rather
  than resending the original issue prompt.
- Supply the implementation's documented approval and sandbox policy using fields supported by the
  targeted protocol.
- Include issue-identifying metadata, such as `<issue.identifier>: <issue.title>`, when the targeted
  protocol supports turn or session titles.
- Advertise implemented client-side tools using the targeted protocol.

Session identifiers:

- Extract `thread_id` from the thread identity returned by the targeted Codex app-server protocol.
- Extract `turn_id` from each turn identity returned by the targeted Codex app-server protocol.
- Emit `session_id = "<thread_id>-<turn_id>"`
- Reuse the same `thread_id` for all continuation turns inside one worker run

### 10.3 Streaming Turn Processing

The client processes app-server updates according to the targeted Codex app-server protocol until
the active turn terminates.

Completion conditions:

- Targeted-protocol turn completion signal -> success
- Targeted-protocol turn failure signal -> failure
- Targeted-protocol turn cancellation signal -> failure
- turn timeout (`turn_timeout_ms`) -> failure
- subprocess exit -> failure

Continuation processing:

- If the worker decides to continue after a successful turn, it SHOULD start another turn on the same
  live thread using the targeted protocol.
- The app-server subprocess SHOULD remain alive across those continuation turns and be stopped only
  when the worker run is ending.

Transport handling requirements:

- Follow the transport and framing rules of the targeted Codex app-server version.
- For stdio-based transports, keep protocol stream handling separate from diagnostic stderr
  handling unless the targeted protocol specifies otherwise.

### 10.4 Emitted Runtime Events (Upstream to Orchestrator)

The app-server client emits structured events to the orchestrator callback. Each event SHOULD
include:

- `event` (enum/string)
- `timestamp` (UTC timestamp)
- `codex_app_server_pid` (if available)
- OPTIONAL `usage` map (token counts)
- payload fields as needed

Important emitted events include, for example:

- `session_started`
- `startup_failed`
- `turn_completed`
- `turn_failed`
- `turn_cancelled`
- `turn_ended_with_error`
- `turn_input_required`
- `approval_auto_approved`
- `unsupported_tool_call`
- `notification`
- `other_message`
- `malformed`

### 10.5 Approval, Tool Calls, and User Input Policy

Approval, sandbox, and user-input behavior is implementation-defined.

Policy requirements:

- Each implementation MUST document its chosen approval, sandbox, and operator-confirmation
  posture.
- Approval requests and user-input-required events MUST NOT leave a run stalled indefinitely. An
  implementation MAY either satisfy them, surface them to an operator, auto-resolve them, or
  fail the run according to its documented policy.

Example high-trust behavior:

- Auto-approve command execution approvals for the session.
- Auto-approve file-change approvals for the session.
- Treat user-input-required turns as hard failure.

Unsupported dynamic tool calls:

- Supported dynamic tool calls that are explicitly implemented and advertised by the runtime SHOULD
  be handled according to their extension contract.
- If the agent requests a dynamic tool call that is not supported, return a tool failure response
  using the targeted protocol and continue the session.
- This prevents the session from stalling on unsupported tool execution paths.

Optional client-side tool extension:

- An implementation MAY expose a limited set of client-side tools to the app-server session.
- Current standardized optional tools: `linear_graphql` and `wait_for`.
- If implemented, supported tools SHOULD be advertised to the app-server session during startup
  using the protocol mechanism supported by the targeted Codex app-server version.
- Unsupported tool names SHOULD still return a failure result using the targeted protocol and
  continue the session.

`linear_graphql` extension contract:

- Purpose: execute a raw GraphQL query or mutation against Linear using Symphony's configured
  tracker auth for the current session.
- Availability: only meaningful when `tracker.kind == "linear"` and valid Linear auth is configured.
- Preferred input shape:

  ```json
  {
    "query": "single GraphQL query or mutation document",
    "variables": {
      "optional": "graphql variables object"
    }
  }
  ```

- `query` MUST be a non-empty string.
- `query` MUST contain exactly one GraphQL operation.
- `variables` is OPTIONAL and, when present, MUST be a JSON object.
- Implementations MAY additionally accept a raw GraphQL query string as shorthand input.
- Execute one GraphQL operation per tool call.
- If the provided document contains multiple operations, reject the tool call as invalid input.
- `operationName` selection is intentionally out of scope for this extension.
- Reuse the configured Linear endpoint and auth from the active Symphony workflow/runtime config; do
  not require the coding agent to read raw tokens from disk.
- Tool result semantics:
  - transport success + no top-level GraphQL `errors` -> `success=true`
  - top-level GraphQL `errors` present -> `success=false`, but preserve the GraphQL response body
    for debugging
  - an accepted deferred handoff review -> `success=true` with a distinct status and explicit
    instructions to end the turn without retrying the mutation
  - invalid input, missing auth, or transport failure -> `success=false` with an error payload
- Return the GraphQL response or error payload as structured tool output that the model can inspect
  in-session.

`wait_for` extension contract:

- Purpose: stop spending model turns while useful work is blocked only on an external state change.
- The request MUST include a non-empty reason and one typed condition. Standard condition types are
  GitHub Actions component recovery, GitHub PR-check state changes, git-ref SHA changes, Linear
  issue/comment changes.
- Implementations MUST reject clock-only waits. Agents MUST NOT park for local resource pressure,
  another validation, local process/port contention, or an elapsed-time backoff; independently
  bounded validations may overlap across agents.
- Change-based conditions MUST include the observation the agent just saw. The watcher MUST NOT
  resume merely because it observed the same value again.
- A successful tool call records the request in the worker lifecycle. The agent SHOULD end its turn;
  on normal worker exit, the orchestrator retains the workspace and claim, persists the wait, and
  releases the agent slot.
- Probes MUST run outside coding-agent/model sessions. Identical condition keys SHOULD share one
  probe, with bounded exponential backoff for unchanged or failed probes.
- A changed condition MUST re-enter the normal priority, dependency, capacity, and concurrency
  scheduler exactly once with a compact prompt describing the state change. Durable ready state
  SHOULD remain until a replacement worker has actually started.
- Operators SHOULD be able to resume immediately or cancel the external condition. Cancelling a
  wait returns the still-active issue to normal scheduling; it does not abandon the tracker issue.

User-input-required policy:

- Implementations MUST document how targeted-protocol user-input-required signals are handled.
- A run MUST NOT stall indefinitely waiting for user input.
- A conforming implementation MAY fail the run, surface the request to an operator, satisfy it
  through an approved operator channel, or auto-resolve it according to its documented policy.
- The example high-trust behavior above fails user-input-required turns immediately.

### 10.6 Timeouts and Error Mapping

Timeouts:

- `codex.read_timeout_ms`: request/response timeout during startup and sync requests
- `codex.turn_timeout_ms`: absolute wall-clock turn timeout; streamed activity MUST NOT reset it
- `codex.stall_timeout_ms`: enforced by orchestrator based on event inactivity

Error mapping (RECOMMENDED normalized categories):

- `codex_not_found`
- `invalid_workspace_cwd`
- `response_timeout`
- `turn_timeout`
- `port_exit`
- `response_error`
- `turn_failed`
- `turn_cancelled`
- `turn_input_required`

### 10.7 Agent Runner Contract

The `Agent Runner` wraps workspace + prompt + app-server client.

Behavior:

1. Create/reuse workspace for issue.
2. Build prompt from workflow template.
3. Start app-server session.
4. Forward app-server events to orchestrator.
5. On any error, fail the worker attempt (the orchestrator will retry).

Note:

- Workspaces are intentionally preserved after successful runs.

## 11. Issue Tracker Integration Contract (Linear-Compatible)

### 11.1 REQUIRED Operations

An implementation MUST support these tracker adapter operations:

1. `fetch_candidate_issues()`
   - Return issues in configured active states for a configured project.

2. `fetch_issues_by_states(state_names)`
   - Used for startup terminal cleanup.

3. `fetch_issue_states_by_ids(issue_ids)`
   - Used for active-run reconciliation.

4. `fetch_issue_comments(issue_id)`
   - Used once immediately before an outer agent dispatch to assemble required issue activity.
   - Returns normalized comments plus a truncation marker.

### 11.2 Query Semantics (Linear)

Linear-specific requirements for `tracker.kind == "linear"`:

- `tracker.kind == "linear"`
- GraphQL endpoint (default `https://api.linear.app/graphql`)
- Auth token sent in `Authorization` header
- `tracker.project_slug` maps to Linear project `slugId`
- Candidate issue query filters project using `project: { slugId: { eq: $projectSlug } }`
- Issue-state refresh query uses GraphQL issue IDs with variable type `[ID!]`
- Issue-comment query requests at most `50` comments ordered by `updatedAt`, then presents the
  captured window chronologically in the first turn.
- Pagination REQUIRED for candidate issues
- Page size default: `50`
- Network timeout: `30000 ms`

Important:

- Linear GraphQL schema details can drift. Keep query construction isolated and test the exact query
  fields/types REQUIRED by this specification.

A non-Linear implementation MAY change transport details, but the normalized outputs MUST match the
domain model in Section 4.

### 11.3 Normalization Rules

Candidate issue normalization SHOULD produce fields listed in Section 4.1.1.

Additional normalization details:

- `labels` -> lowercase strings
- `blocked_by` -> derived from inverse relations where relation type is `blocks`
- `priority` -> integer only (non-integers become null)
- `created_at` and `updated_at` -> parse ISO-8601 timestamps

### 11.4 Error Handling Contract

RECOMMENDED error categories:

- `unsupported_tracker_kind`
- `missing_tracker_api_key`
- `missing_tracker_project_slug`
- `linear_api_request` (transport failures)
- `linear_api_status` (non-200 HTTP)
- `linear_graphql_errors`
- `linear_unknown_payload`
- `linear_missing_end_cursor` (pagination integrity error)

Orchestrator behavior on tracker errors:

- Candidate fetch failure: log and skip dispatch for this tick.
- Running-state refresh failure: log and keep active workers running.
- Startup terminal cleanup failure: log warning and continue startup.

### 11.5 Tracker Writes (Important Boundary)

Symphony does not require first-class tracker write APIs in the orchestrator.

- Ticket mutations (state transitions, comments, PR metadata) are typically handled by the coding
  agent using tools defined by the workflow prompt.
- The service remains a scheduler/runner and tracker reader.
- Workflow-specific success often means "reached the next handoff state" (for example
  `Human Review`) rather than tracker terminal state `Done`.
- If the `linear_graphql` client-side tool extension is implemented, it is still part of the agent
  toolchain rather than orchestrator business logic.

## 12. Prompt Construction and Context Assembly

### 12.1 Inputs

Inputs to prompt rendering:

- `workflow.prompt_template`
- normalized `issue` object
- OPTIONAL `attempt` integer (retry/continuation metadata)

The first turn is assembled in this order:

1. A canonical host-owned task context containing normalized issue details.
2. The normalized comment activity fetched immediately before dispatch.
3. Annotated Markdown startup artifacts produced by `session_start`, when present.
4. The rendered repository workflow template.
5. Any host-owned handoff-tool guidance.

Repository templates do not need to reconstruct issue details, activity, or startup-artifact
meaning. Later in-worker turns retain the original task context and use the live tracker tool only
for newer or omitted context.

### 12.2 Rendering Rules

- Render with strict variable checking.
- Render with strict filter checking.
- Convert issue object keys to strings for template compatibility.
- Preserve nested arrays/maps (labels, blockers) so templates can iterate.

### 12.3 Retry/Continuation Semantics

`attempt` SHOULD be passed to the template because the workflow prompt can provide different
instructions for:

- first run (`attempt` null or absent)
- continuation run after a successful prior session
- retry after error/timeout/stall

### 12.4 Failure Semantics

If prompt rendering fails:

- Fail the run attempt immediately.
- Let the orchestrator treat it like any other worker failure and decide retry behavior.

## 13. Logging, Status, and Observability

### 13.1 Logging Conventions

REQUIRED context fields for issue-related logs:

- `issue_id`
- `issue_identifier`

REQUIRED context for coding-agent session lifecycle logs:

- `session_id`

Message formatting requirements:

- Use stable `key=value` phrasing.
- Include action outcome (`completed`, `failed`, `retrying`, etc.).
- Include concise failure reason when present.
- Avoid logging large raw payloads unless necessary.

### 13.2 Logging Outputs and Sinks

The spec does not prescribe where logs are written (stderr, file, remote sink, etc.).

Requirements:

- Operators MUST be able to see startup/validation/dispatch failures without attaching a debugger.
- Implementations MAY write to one or more sinks.
- If a configured log sink fails, the service SHOULD continue running when possible and emit an
  operator-visible warning through any remaining sink.

### 13.3 Runtime Snapshot / Monitoring Interface (OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED)

If the implementation exposes a synchronous runtime snapshot (for dashboards or monitoring), it
SHOULD return:

- `running` (list of running session rows)
- each running row SHOULD include `turn_count`
- each running row SHOULD expose the actual coding-agent backend and model when known
- when issue-aware routing is enabled, each running row SHOULD expose the selected reasoning effort
  and profile
- `retrying` (list of retry queue rows)
- `waiting` (list of durable external-condition wait rows)
- `codex_totals`
  - `input_tokens`
  - `output_tokens`
  - `total_tokens`
  - `seconds_running` (aggregate runtime seconds as of snapshot time, including active sessions)
- `rate_limits` (latest coding-agent rate limit payload, if available)
- `backend_usage` (active backend/account rows, if available)
  - Include the backend, account scope, running-session count, snapshot timestamp, and latest
    provider rate-limit payload.
  - Keep distinct account scopes separate because remote workers may use different credentials.
  - Human-readable dashboards SHOULD identify 5-hour and weekly windows by their reported duration
    rather than assuming provider bucket order.
  - Backends that do not report account-limit usage SHOULD remain visible with usage marked
    unavailable; the absence of provider data MUST NOT be presented as zero usage.

RECOMMENDED snapshot error modes:

- `timeout`
- `unavailable`

### 13.4 OPTIONAL Human-Readable Status Surface

A human-readable status surface (terminal output, dashboard, etc.) is OPTIONAL and
implementation-defined.

If present, it SHOULD draw from orchestrator state/metrics only and MUST NOT be REQUIRED for
correctness.

### 13.5 Session Metrics and Token Accounting

Token accounting rules:

- Agent events can include token counts in multiple payload shapes.
- Prefer absolute thread totals when available, such as:
  - `thread/tokenUsage/updated` payloads
  - `total_token_usage` within token-count wrapper events
- Ignore delta-style payloads such as `last_token_usage` for dashboard/API totals.
- Extract input/output/total token counts leniently from common field names within the selected
  payload.
- For absolute totals, track a high-water mark per actual backend thread, not merely per issue,
  run, or parent session. Accept only the positive difference from that thread's prior high water.
  Repeated or out-of-order snapshots MUST NOT be summed, and an interrupted/incomplete thread MUST
  retain its latest valid cumulative totals.
- Parent and delegated thread totals MUST reconcile to issue/session/fleet totals without counting
  a delegated snapshot as part of the parent's cumulative counter.
- Preserve input, cached input, output, reasoning, total, current-context, and context-window
  meanings as distinct fields. Cached input and reasoning are dimensions of provider usage and
  MUST NOT be added to a provider `total_tokens` value a second time.
- Do not treat generic `usage` maps as cumulative totals unless the event type defines them that
  way.
- Accumulate aggregate totals in orchestrator state.

Runtime accounting:

- Runtime SHOULD be reported as a live aggregate at snapshot/render time.
- Implementations MAY maintain a cumulative counter for ended sessions and add active-session
  elapsed time derived from `running` entries (for example `started_at`) when producing a
  snapshot/status view.
- Add run duration seconds to the cumulative ended-session runtime when a session ends (normal exit
  or cancellation/termination).
- Continuous background ticking of runtime totals is not REQUIRED.

Rate-limit tracking:

- Track the latest rate-limit payload seen in any agent update.
- Any human-readable presentation of rate-limit data is implementation-defined.

### 13.6 Compact Fleet Events and Session Retention

Implementations SHOULD maintain a compact, versioned analytics stream independent of humanized
transcripts. The stable event vocabulary SHOULD cover run/session/thread/turn lifecycle, prompt
size and injected-section hashes, token high waters and accepted deltas, phase transitions, tool
boundaries/outcomes/output size/artifact references, typed failure/retry/circuit decisions,
gate/attestation/review identity and reuse, lease lifecycle, base-drift/overlap decisions, and
available handoff/CI/reopen/blocking-finding/merge/revert quality outcomes.

Compact reporting SHOULD provide fleet, repository, issue, parent/delegated-thread, phase,
failure-class, tool, review, and percentile views. At minimum it SHOULD include p50/p90 token and
duration, delegation share, gate reuse, retries by failure class, tool output bytes, and quality
guardrails. Reports MUST reconstruct token totals from each actual thread's cumulative high water,
never by summing repeated absolute snapshots. Percentiles SHOULD use conventional nearest-rank
semantics so small samples do not understate their upper tail.

Session persistence SHOULD coalesce high-frequency streaming/token notifications or maintain an
equivalent bounded analytics index. Existing NDJSON readers SHOULD remain compatible or receive a
migration path. Selectively retained raw traces MAY be compressed, but protocol/security/
correctness failures MUST retain enough redacted evidence for diagnosis. Operators MUST have a
documented temporary raw-trace/debug escape hatch. When raw originals are valid structured
documents, retention SHOULD preserve their complete recursively redacted shape rather than apply
the compact fleet-event string bound; unparseable originals SHOULD retain safe size/hash metadata
instead of opaque content. Operator-configured redaction names SHOULD extend a mandatory credential
baseline rather than permit an empty/custom list to disable baseline privacy protection.

Compact lifecycle/error analytics SHOULD support rolling 7- and 30-day analysis. Retention policy
MUST define durations, sampling, privacy, recursive secret-field redaction, and cleanup. Destructive
session-log cleanup SHOULD be dry-run by default, require explicit apply intent, report selected and
reclaimed bytes, and protect active session paths. Benign
per-notification debug logs SHOULD be disabled by default so lifecycle/error history is not rotated
away by streaming chatter.

### 13.7 Telemetry-Driven Soft Budgets and Routing

Repository workflows MAY configure `agent.efficiency` with `mode` (`off`, `shadow`, or `enforce`),
a bounded resume-capsule size, an extreme-outlier multiplier, task-type-to-budget-profile mappings,
and per-profile thresholds. Implementations SHOULD provide distinct simple, standard, and high-risk
defaults derived from recent fleet percentiles rather than one global ceiling. Required dimensions
include issue/run total, parent/delegated and per-thread high waters, per-turn growth, uncached/cached
input, prompt/review-packet/tool-output bytes, elapsed phase time, requested reviewer lenses, and
review iterations.

The execution classifier SHOULD report one of `simple_direct`, `ui`, `security_tenant`,
`data_schema`, `concurrency_liveness`, or `broad_architecture`, together with confidence, bounded
input metadata, result/reasons, and override provenance. Missing/low-confidence telemetry and
security, tenant, schema, concurrency, or broad-architecture signals MUST fail toward a quality
fallback. Operators MAY override execution routing with an exact `agent:<profile>` label and budget
routing with one exact valid `budget:<profile>` label. A present invalid budget label or more than
one distinct valid budget profile MUST fail toward the high-risk budget with inspectable
provenance.

Soft-budget accounting MUST use actual parent/delegated thread cumulative high waters and survive
continuation turns. A threshold identity is latched for the run: duplicate or out-of-order absolute
usage notifications MUST NOT produce repeated warning prompts or transitions. Callback accounting
SHOULD normalize and coalesce cumulative signals without retaining full protocol events in the
runner mailbox, and a continuation-boundary snapshot MUST include callbacks begun before the turn
returned. Tool-output bytes MUST come from terminal tool events rather than streaming deltas.
`shadow` records the same proposed decisions/transitions without changing agent prompts. `enforce`
applies a one-shot, bounded strategy capsule at a safe continuation boundary. Strategies MAY compact
parent state, require fresh thin-context delegation/review, reuse exact-head gate evidence,
constrain future tool output, select risk-relevant reviewer lenses/model/reasoning, synthesize open
findings, or escalate an extreme outlier with a complete resume packet.

Budgets are never completion or approval criteria. Reaching one MUST NOT mark work complete, approve
a review, skip required security/tenant validation, reduce mandatory high-risk lenses/evidence, or
suppress unresolved findings. A high-risk policy MAY explicitly allow overage while preserving or
strengthening reviewer effort, packet capacity, lens coverage, and iteration count. Compact reports
SHOULD compare rolling tokens, time, review findings, CI/human outcomes, and extreme outliers, and
expose classifier/budget decisions and applied versus shadow transitions.

### 13.8 Humanized Agent Event Summaries (OPTIONAL)

Humanized summaries of raw agent protocol events are OPTIONAL.

If implemented:

- Treat them as observability-only output.
- Do not make orchestrator logic depend on humanized strings.

### 13.9 OPTIONAL HTTP Server Extension

This section defines an OPTIONAL HTTP interface for observability and operational control.

If implemented:

- The HTTP server is an extension and is not REQUIRED for conformance.
- The implementation MAY serve server-rendered HTML or a client-side application for the dashboard.
- The dashboard/API MUST be observability/control surfaces only and MUST NOT become REQUIRED for
  orchestrator correctness.

Extension config:

- `server.port` (integer, OPTIONAL)
  - Enables the HTTP server extension.
  - `0` requests an ephemeral port for local development and tests.
  - CLI `--port` overrides `server.port` when both are present.

Enablement (extension):

- Start the HTTP server when a CLI `--port` argument is provided.
- Start the HTTP server when `server.port` is present in `WORKFLOW.md` front matter.
- The `server` top-level key is owned by this extension.
- Positive `server.port` values bind that port.
- Implementations SHOULD bind loopback by default (`127.0.0.1` or host equivalent) unless explicitly
  configured otherwise.
- Changes to HTTP listener settings (for example `server.port`) do not need to hot-rebind;
  restart-required behavior is conformant.

#### 13.7.1 Human-Readable Dashboard (`/`)

- Host a human-readable dashboard at `/`.
- The returned document SHOULD depict the current state of the system (for example active sessions,
  retry delays, token consumption, runtime totals, recent events, and health/error indicators).
- Implementations MAY coalesce change notifications and show a bounded, incrementally updated
  transcript window in the live dashboard, provided an explicit operational-debugging path remains
  available for the complete persisted transcript.
- It is up to the implementation whether this is server-generated HTML or a client-side app that
  consumes the JSON API below.

#### 13.7.2 JSON REST API (`/api/v1/*`)

Provide a JSON REST API under `/api/v1/*` for current runtime state and operational debugging.

Minimum endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/state`
  - Returns a summary view of the current system state (running sessions, retry queue/delays,
    aggregate token/runtime totals, latest rate limits, and any additional tracked summary fields).
  - Suggested response shape:

  - If the issue is unknown to the current in-memory state, return `404` with an error response (for
    example `{\"error\":{\"code\":\"issue_not_found\",\"message\":\"...\"}}`).

- `POST /api/v1/refresh`
  - Queues an immediate tracker poll + reconciliation cycle (best-effort trigger; implementations
    MAY coalesce repeated requests).

    }
    ```

- `POST /api/v1/drain` (extension)
  - Persists drain mode and pauses new dispatch, retry execution, and provider probes without
    stopping live workers.
- `POST /api/v1/resume` (extension)
  - Cancels drain mode and schedules an immediate tracker poll.
- `POST /api/v1/shutdown-policy/preserve` (extension)
  - Persists the policy that graceful application shutdown, including Ctrl+C, leaves detached
    workers running for reconnection.
- `POST /api/v1/shutdown-policy/terminate` (extension)
  - Persists the policy that graceful application shutdown stops tracked workers and their owned
    subprocess trees before exiting.
- `POST /api/v1/waits/:issue_identifier/resume` (extension)
  - Wakes one parked issue without waiting for its next probe.
- `POST /api/v1/waits/:issue_identifier/cancel` (extension)
  - Cancels the external wait and returns the active issue to normal scheduling.

API design notes:

- The JSON shapes above are the RECOMMENDED baseline for interoperability and debugging ergonomics.
- Implementations MAY add fields, but SHOULD avoid breaking existing fields within a version.
- Endpoints SHOULD be read-only except for operational triggers like `/refresh`.
- Unsupported methods on defined routes SHOULD return `405 Method Not Allowed`.
- API errors SHOULD use a JSON envelope such as `{"error":{"code":"...","message":"..."}}`.
- If the dashboard is a client-side app, it SHOULD consume this API rather than duplicating state
  logic.

## 14. Failure Model and Recovery Strategy

### 14.1 Failure Classes

1. `Workflow/Config Failures`
   - Missing `WORKFLOW.md`
   - Invalid YAML front matter
   - Unsupported tracker kind or missing tracker credentials/project slug
   - Missing coding-agent executable

2. `Workspace Failures`
   - Workspace directory creation failure
   - Workspace population/synchronization failure (implementation-defined; can come from hooks)
   - Invalid workspace path configuration
   - Hook timeout/failure

3. `Agent Session Failures`
   - Startup handshake failure
   - Turn failed/cancelled
   - Turn timeout
   - User input requested and handled as failure by the implementation's documented policy
   - Subprocess exit
   - Stalled session (no activity)

4. `Tracker Failures`
   - API transport errors
   - Non-200 status
   - GraphQL errors
   - malformed payloads

5. `Observability Failures`
   - Snapshot timeout
   - Dashboard render errors
   - Log sink configuration failure

### 14.2 Recovery Behavior

- Dispatch validation failures:
  - Skip new dispatches.
  - Keep service alive.
  - Continue reconciliation where possible.

- Worker failures:
  - Convert to retries with exponential backoff.

- Tracker candidate-fetch failures:
  - Skip this tick.
  - Try again on next tick.

- Reconciliation state-refresh failures:
  - Keep current workers.
  - Retry on next tick.

- Dashboard/log failures:
  - Do not crash the orchestrator.

### 14.3 Partial State Recovery (Restart)

The baseline design is intentionally in-memory for scheduler state. Restart recovery means a
conforming service can resume useful operation by polling tracker state and reusing preserved
workspaces; retry timers are not required to survive.

The Elixir implementation additionally launches each live run in a detached worker BEAM. The
worker owns the backend process and stdio port and exposes an authenticated loopback channel. The
orchestrator owns a replaceable relay, acknowledges ordered events with a bounded runtime
checkpoint, and reconnects after restart. This preserves an in-flight coding-agent process without
requiring a database or attempting to reattach an Erlang port from a new VM.

After restart:

- No retry timers are restored from prior process memory.
- Durable external-condition waits and ready wake-ups MAY be restored independently of the general
  retry queue. Restored waits retain their claims and resume through the normal scheduler.
- A baseline implementation MAY assume no running sessions are recoverable and recover by:
  - startup terminal workspace cleanup
  - fresh polling of active issues
  - re-dispatching eligible work
- A reconnectable-worker implementation SHOULD adopt authenticated live workers before dispatch,
  claim their issue ids, restore their last acknowledged runtime checkpoint, and replay later
  events. An unreachable worker record must not authorize duplicate concurrent work.

### 14.4 Operator Intervention Points

Operators can control behavior by:

- Enabling persisted drain mode to pause new work while live workers continue, then cancelling it
  to resume normal dispatch.
- Selecting a persisted shutdown policy independently of drain mode. A reconnecting restart
  preserves workers; a full shutdown terminates workers and their owned subprocess trees.
- Resuming one parked wait immediately or cancelling its external condition from the dashboard/API.
- Editing `WORKFLOW.md` (prompt and most runtime settings).
- `WORKFLOW.md` changes are detected and re-applied automatically without restart according to
  Section 6.2.
- Changing issue states in the tracker:
  - terminal state -> running session is stopped and workspace cleaned when reconciled
  - non-active state -> running session is stopped without cleanup
- Restarting the service for process recovery or deployment (not as the normal path for applying
  workflow config changes).

## 15. Security and Operational Safety

### 15.1 Trust Boundary Assumption

Each implementation defines its own trust boundary.

Operational safety requirements:

- Implementations SHOULD state clearly whether they are intended for trusted environments, more
  restrictive environments, or both.
- Implementations SHOULD state clearly whether they rely on auto-approved actions, operator
  approvals, stricter sandboxing, or some combination of those controls.
- Workspace isolation and path validation are important baseline controls, but they are not a
  substitute for whatever approval and sandbox policy an implementation chooses.

### 15.2 Filesystem Safety Requirements

Mandatory:

- Workspace path MUST remain under configured workspace root.
- Coding-agent cwd MUST be the per-issue workspace path for the current run.
- Workspace directory names MUST use sanitized identifiers.

RECOMMENDED additional hardening for ports:

- Run under a dedicated OS user.
- Restrict workspace root permissions.
- Mount workspace root on a dedicated volume if possible.

### 15.3 Secret Handling

- Support `$VAR` indirection in workflow config.
- Do not log API tokens or secret env values.
- Validate presence of secrets without printing them.

### 15.4 Hook Script Safety

Workspace hooks are arbitrary shell scripts from `WORKFLOW.md`.

Implications:

- Hooks are fully trusted configuration.
- Hooks run inside the workspace directory.
- Hook output SHOULD be truncated in logs.
- Hook timeouts are REQUIRED to avoid hanging the orchestrator.

### 15.5 Harness Hardening Guidance

Running Codex agents against repositories, issue trackers, and other inputs that can contain
sensitive data or externally-controlled content can be dangerous. A permissive deployment can lead
to data leaks, destructive mutations, or full machine compromise if the agent is induced to execute
harmful commands or use overly-powerful integrations.

Implementations SHOULD explicitly evaluate their own risk profile and harden the execution harness
where appropriate. This specification intentionally does not mandate a single hardening posture, but
implementations SHOULD NOT assume that tracker data, repository contents, prompt inputs, or tool
arguments are fully trustworthy just because they originate inside a normal workflow.

Possible hardening measures include:

- Tightening Codex approval and sandbox settings described elsewhere in this specification instead
  of running with a maximally permissive configuration.
- Adding external isolation layers such as OS/container/VM sandboxing, network restrictions, or
  separate credentials beyond the built-in Codex policy controls.
- Filtering which Linear issues, projects, teams, labels, or other tracker sources are eligible for
  dispatch so untrusted or out-of-scope tasks do not automatically reach the agent.
- Narrowing the `linear_graphql` tool so it can only read or mutate data inside the
  intended project scope, rather than exposing general workspace-wide tracker access.
- Reducing the set of client-side tools, credentials, filesystem paths, and network destinations
  available to the agent to the minimum needed for the workflow.

The correct controls are deployment-specific, but implementations SHOULD document them clearly and
treat harness hardening as part of the core safety model rather than an optional afterthought.

## 17. Test and Validation Matrix

A conforming implementation SHOULD include tests that cover the behaviors defined in this
specification.

Validation profiles:

- `Core Conformance`: deterministic tests REQUIRED for all conforming implementations.
- `Extension Conformance`: REQUIRED only for OPTIONAL features that an implementation chooses to
  ship.
- `Real Integration Profile`: environment-dependent smoke/integration checks RECOMMENDED before
  production use.

Unless otherwise noted, Sections 17.1 through 17.7 are `Core Conformance`. Bullets that begin with
`If ... is implemented` are `Extension Conformance`.

### 17.1 Workflow and Config Parsing

- Workflow file path precedence:
  - explicit runtime path is used when provided
  - cwd default is `WORKFLOW.md` when no explicit runtime path is provided
- Workflow file changes are detected and trigger re-read/re-apply without restart
- Invalid workflow reload keeps last known good effective configuration and emits an
  operator-visible error
- Missing `WORKFLOW.md` returns typed error
- Invalid YAML front matter returns typed error
- Front matter non-map returns typed error
- Config defaults apply when OPTIONAL values are missing
- `tracker.kind` validation enforces currently supported kind (`linear`)
- `tracker.api_key` works (including `$VAR` indirection)
- `$VAR` resolution works for tracker API key and path values
- `~` path expansion works
- `codex.command` is preserved as a shell command string
- Per-state concurrency override map normalizes state names and ignores invalid values
- Prompt template renders `issue` and `attempt`
- Prompt rendering fails on unknown variables (strict mode)

### 17.2 Workspace Manager and Safety

- Deterministic workspace path per issue identifier
- Missing workspace directory is created
- Existing workspace directory is reused
- Existing non-directory path at workspace location is handled safely (replace or fail per
  implementation policy)
- OPTIONAL workspace population/synchronization errors are surfaced
- `after_create` hook runs only on new workspace creation
- `session_start` hook runs before each fresh or resumed agent session; failures are non-fatal and
  are represented in canonical first-turn task context plus `gate.session_start` telemetry
- `before_run` hook runs before each attempt and failure/timeouts abort the current attempt
- `after_run` hook runs after each attempt and failure/timeouts are logged and ignored
- `before_remove` hook runs on cleanup and failures/timeouts are ignored
- Workspace path sanitization and root containment invariants are enforced before agent launch
- Agent launch uses the per-issue workspace path as cwd and rejects out-of-root paths

### 17.3 Issue Tracker Client

- Candidate issue fetch uses active states and project slug
- Linear query uses the specified project filter field (`slugId`)
- Empty `fetch_issues_by_states([])` returns empty without API call
- Pagination preserves order across multiple pages
- Blockers are normalized from inverse relations of type `blocks`
- Labels are normalized to lowercase
- Issue state refresh by ID returns minimal normalized issues
- Issue state refresh query uses GraphQL ID typing (`[ID!]`) as specified in Section 11.2
- Error mapping for request errors, non-200, GraphQL errors, malformed payloads

### 17.4 Orchestrator Dispatch, Reconciliation, and Retry

- Dispatch sort order is priority then oldest creation time
- `Todo` issue with non-terminal blockers is not eligible
- `Todo` issue with terminal blockers is eligible
- Active-state issue refresh updates running entry state
- Non-active state stops running agent without workspace cleanup
- Terminal state stops running agent and cleans workspace
- Reconciliation with no running issues is a no-op
- Normal worker exit schedules a short continuation retry (attempt 1)
- Abnormal worker exit increments retries with 10s-based exponential backoff
- Retry backoff cap uses configured `agent.max_retry_backoff_ms`
- Retry queue entries include attempt, due time, identifier, and error
- Stall detection kills stalled sessions and schedules retry
- Pending handoff review suppresses implementor stall detection and redispatch
- Pending handoff review uses reviewer-specific heartbeat/timeout handling
- Stale reviewer worker/job events do not mutate a newer running entry
- Repeated handoff requests coalesce while the same review is pending
- A changed PR head withholds the reviewed handoff until a fresh review runs
- Slot exhaustion requeues retries with explicit error reason
- If a snapshot API is implemented, it returns running rows, retry rows, token totals, and rate
  limits
- If a snapshot API is implemented, timeout/unavailable cases are surfaced

### 17.5 Coding-Agent App-Server Client

- Launch command uses workspace cwd and invokes `bash -lc <codex.command>`
- Session startup follows the targeted Codex app-server protocol.
- Client identity/capability payloads are valid when the targeted Codex app-server protocol requires
  them.
- Policy-related startup payloads use the implementation's documented approval/sandbox settings
- Thread and turn identities exposed by the targeted protocol are extracted and used to emit
  `session_started`
- Request/response read timeout is enforced
- Turn timeout is enforced
- Transport framing required by the targeted protocol is handled correctly
- For stdio-based transports, diagnostic stderr handling is kept separate from the protocol stream
- Command/file-change approvals are handled according to the implementation's documented policy
- Unsupported dynamic tool calls are rejected without stalling the session
- User input requests are handled according to the implementation's documented policy and do not
  stall indefinitely
- Usage and rate-limit telemetry exposed by the targeted protocol is extracted
- Approval, user-input-required, usage, and rate-limit signals are interpreted according to the
  targeted protocol
- If client-side tools are implemented, session startup advertises the supported tool specs
  using the targeted app-server protocol
- If the `linear_graphql` client-side tool extension is implemented:
  - the tool is advertised to the session
  - valid `query` / `variables` inputs execute against configured Linear auth
  - top-level GraphQL `errors` produce `success=false` while preserving the GraphQL body
  - accepted deferred handoff reviews produce `success=true` with structured end-turn instructions
  - invalid arguments, missing auth, and transport failures return structured failure payloads
  - unsupported tool names still fail without stalling the session
  - session observability records retain normalized tool result details so deferred handoffs and
    failure categories remain distinguishable
### 17.6 Observability

- Validation failures are operator-visible
- Structured logging includes issue/session context fields
- Logging sink failures do not crash orchestration
- Token/rate-limit aggregation remains correct across repeated agent updates
- If a human-readable status surface is implemented, it is driven from orchestrator state and does
  not affect correctness
- If humanized event summaries are implemented, they cover key wrapper/agent event classes without
  changing orchestrator behavior

### 17.7 CLI and Host Lifecycle

- CLI accepts a positional workflow path argument (`path-to-WORKFLOW.md`)
- CLI uses `./WORKFLOW.md` when no workflow path argument is provided
- CLI errors on nonexistent explicit workflow path or missing default `./WORKFLOW.md`
- CLI surfaces startup failure cleanly
- CLI exits with success when application starts and shuts down normally
- CLI exits nonzero when startup fails or the host process exits abnormally

### 17.8 Real Integration Profile (RECOMMENDED)

These checks are RECOMMENDED for production readiness and MAY be skipped in CI when credentials,
network access, or external service permissions are unavailable.

- A real tracker smoke test can be run with valid credentials supplied by `LINEAR_API_KEY` or a
  documented local bootstrap mechanism (for example `~/.linear_api_key`).
- Real integration tests SHOULD use isolated test identifiers/workspaces and clean up tracker
  artifacts when practical.
- A skipped real-integration test SHOULD be reported as skipped, not silently treated as passed.
- If a real-integration profile is explicitly enabled in CI or release validation, failures SHOULD
  fail that job.

## 18. Implementation Checklist (Definition of Done)

Use the same validation profiles as Section 17:

- Section 18.1 = `Core Conformance`
- Section 18.2 = `Extension Conformance`
- Section 18.3 = `Real Integration Profile`

### 18.1 REQUIRED for Conformance

- Workflow path selection supports explicit runtime path and cwd default
- `WORKFLOW.md` loader with YAML front matter + prompt body split
- Typed config layer with defaults and `$` resolution
- Dynamic `WORKFLOW.md` watch/reload/re-apply for config and prompt
- Polling orchestrator with single-authority mutable state
- Issue tracker client with candidate fetch + state refresh + terminal fetch
- Workspace manager with sanitized per-issue workspaces
- Workspace lifecycle hooks (`after_create`, `before_run`, `after_run`, `before_remove`)
- Hook timeout config (`hooks.timeout_ms`, default `60000`)
- Coding-agent app-server subprocess client with JSON line protocol
- Codex launch command config (`codex.command`, default `codex app-server`)
- Strict prompt rendering with `issue` and `attempt` variables
- Exponential retry queue with continuation retries after normal exit
- Configurable retry backoff cap (`agent.max_retry_backoff_ms`, default 5m)
- Reconciliation that stops runs on terminal/non-active tracker states
- Workspace cleanup for terminal issues (startup sweep + active transition)
- Structured logs with `issue_id`, `issue_identifier`, and `session_id`
- Operator-visible observability (structured logs; OPTIONAL snapshot/status surface)

### 18.2 RECOMMENDED Extensions (Not REQUIRED for Conformance)

- HTTP server extension honors CLI `--port` over `server.port`, uses a safe default bind host, and
  exposes the baseline endpoints/error semantics in Section 13.7 if shipped.
- `linear_graphql` client-side tool extension exposes raw Linear GraphQL access through the
  app-server session using configured Symphony auth.
- TODO: Persist the general retry queue across process restarts. Live detached workers already
  retain their current session metadata in the Elixir implementation.
- TODO: Make observability settings configurable in workflow front matter without prescribing UI
  implementation details.
- TODO: Add first-class tracker write APIs (comments/state transitions) in the orchestrator instead
  of only via agent tools.
- TODO: Add pluggable issue tracker adapters beyond Linear.

### 18.3 Operational Validation Before Production (RECOMMENDED)

- Run the `Real Integration Profile` from Section 17.8 with valid credentials and network access.
- Verify hook execution and workflow path resolution on the target host OS/shell environment.
- If the OPTIONAL HTTP server is shipped, verify the configured port behavior and loopback/default
  bind expectations on the target environment.

## Appendix A. SSH Worker Extension (OPTIONAL)

This appendix describes a common extension profile in which Symphony keeps one central
orchestrator but executes worker runs on one or more remote hosts over SSH.

Extension config:

- `worker.ssh_hosts` (list of SSH host strings, OPTIONAL)
  - When omitted, work runs locally.
- `worker.max_concurrent_agents_per_host` (positive integer, OPTIONAL)
  - Shared per-host cap applied across configured SSH hosts.

### A.1 Execution Model

- The orchestrator remains the single source of truth for polling, claims, retries, and
  reconciliation.
- `worker.ssh_hosts` provides the candidate SSH destinations for remote execution.
- Each worker run is assigned to one host at a time, and that host becomes part of the run's
  effective execution identity along with the issue workspace.
- `workspace.root` is interpreted on the remote host, not on the orchestrator host.
- The coding-agent app-server is launched over SSH stdio instead of as a local subprocess, so the
  orchestrator still owns the session lifecycle even though commands execute remotely.
- Continuation turns inside one worker lifetime SHOULD stay on the same host and workspace.
- A remote host SHOULD satisfy the same basic contract as a local worker environment: reachable
  shell, writable workspace root, coding-agent executable, and any required auth or repository
  prerequisites.

### A.2 Scheduling Notes

- SSH hosts MAY be treated as a pool for dispatch.
- Implementations MAY prefer the previously used host on retries when that host is still
  available.
- `worker.max_concurrent_agents_per_host` is an OPTIONAL shared per-host cap across configured SSH
  hosts.
- When all SSH hosts are at capacity, dispatch SHOULD wait rather than silently falling back to a
  different execution mode.
- Implementations MAY fail over to another host when the original host is unavailable before work
  has meaningfully started.
- Once a run has already produced side effects, a transparent rerun on another host SHOULD be
  treated as a new attempt, not as invisible failover.

### A.3 Problems to Consider

- Remote environment drift:
  - Each host needs the expected shell environment, coding-agent executable, auth, and repository
    prerequisites.
- Workspace locality:
  - Workspaces are usually host-local, so moving an issue to a different host is typically a cold
    restart unless shared storage exists.
- Path and command safety:
  - Remote path resolution, shell quoting, and workspace-boundary checks matter more once execution
    crosses a machine boundary.
- Startup and failover semantics:
  - Implementations SHOULD distinguish host-connectivity/startup failures from in-workspace agent
    failures so the same ticket is not accidentally re-executed on multiple hosts.
- Host health and saturation:
  - A dead or overloaded host SHOULD reduce available capacity, not cause duplicate execution or an
    accidental fallback to local work.
- Cleanup and observability:
  - Operators need to know which host owns a run, where its workspace lives, and whether cleanup
    happened on the right machine.
